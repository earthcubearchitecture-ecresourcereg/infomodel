# Information model development and encoding to use for EarthCube Resource Registry

This repository contains information items for the EarthCube (EC) Resource Registry project. The objective is to define a core vocabulary and information model for an online registry describing and defining the EarthCube cyberinfrastructure landscape. The proposed work includes: 

1 Refining, testing, and documenting an information model and a set of vocabularies for describing EC resources, with a focus on reusable software, repositories, specifications, functional interfaces, and semantic resources; 
2 Implementing a triple store and text/keyword database with registry content for a set of already completed EC resources, along with examples of resources from outside EC that are widely used in the EC community; 
3 Generating example queries to access information in the datastores; 
4 Defining processes for updating and maintaining the registry. 

The project will deliver a triple store and text/keyword database deployed on EC infrastructure, populated with an initial set of resource descriptions, documents describing the information model and vocabularies, and the engagement and maintenance plan. Work will be coordinated with [EC p418](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418), its follow-on p419, and other EarthCube projects to assure an interoperable system and maximize use of existing technology.
