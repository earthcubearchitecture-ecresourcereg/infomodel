# Information model development and encoding to use for EarthCube Resource Registry

This repository contains information items for the EarthCube (EC) Resource Registry project. The objective is to define a core vocabulary and information model for an online registry describing and defining the EarthCube cyberinfrastructure landscape. The proposed work includes: 

1  Refining, testing, and documenting an information model and a set of vocabularies for describing EC resources, with a focus on reusable software, repositories, specifications, functional interfaces, and semantic resources; 

2  Implementing a triple store and text/keyword database with registry content for a set of already completed EC resources, along with examples of resources from outside EC that are widely used in the EC community; 

3  Generating example queries to access information in the datastores; 

4  Defining processes for updating and maintaining the registry. 

The project will deliver a triple store and text/keyword database deployed on EC infrastructure, populated with an initial set of resource descriptions, documents describing the information model and vocabularies, and the engagement and maintenance plan. Work will be coordinated with [EC p418](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418), its follow-on p419, and other EarthCube projects to assure an interoperable system and maximize use of existing technology.

[Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jFGjp2_QRT1z2YR4DJZwA-OTaj41zpdkUiX_JxBoISU/edit#gid=595054221) containing description of resource entities, properties and vocabularies for draft inforamtion model.  This is a livign document, updated as we develop test descriptions (see '[Test descriptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MJTBvUaqTBbkBJ4mY8aKiSrxOjzcOUSGgho7rWcSM3s/edit#gid=1954101510)' spreadsheet), and will be formalized in a schema for final implementation.

[Test descriptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MJTBvUaqTBbkBJ4mY8aKiSrxOjzcOUSGgho7rWcSM3s/edit#gid=1954101510)  Spreadsheet workbook with a separate tab (worksheet) for each resource type in the scope of the registry. This is being manually populated to test the information model. 

# Vocabularies
At this point, most of the fields in the resource descriptions are being populated in an ad hoc fashion to get a bottom-up sense of what kind of information is useful and can be applied to the broad spectrum of resoruces in scope. Based on analysis of values added during the testing phase, we will propose draft controlled vocabularies for better interoperability where that is determined to be useful.
